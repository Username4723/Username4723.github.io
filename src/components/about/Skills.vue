    <b-card-title>Things I Can Do</b-card-title>
    I can program a bit. After all, I made this website. Besides that, I'm proficient in Java, NodeJS (and some frameworks), and Python 3.
    <br/>
    I can also 3d print and laser engrave, provided the proper machines. I'm still learning when it comes to SLA printers and CNC machines, though.
    <br/>
    Of course, I can work with tools such as git and CI systems - this website is open-source, after all.
    <br/>
    I use Linux, so I know my way around the terminal and how to use the command line. That also means I can't play half the games you can.
    <br/>
    Lastly, I know how to use a search engine to look up an error message. *Surprised Pikachu*. No, seriously, a lot of people can't.
    <br/>
    Occasionally I play Chess (though I'm not really good at it) or read science-fiction and fantasy books.
