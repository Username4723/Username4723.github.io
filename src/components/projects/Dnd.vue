    Surprise! I'm a massive nerd!
    <br/>
    ...
    <br/>
    Okay, that wasn't a surprise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I occasionally play D&D. I haven't played it in a few months, but whatever. My current planned campaign is ArcanaxTechxFantasy, using the 5th edition rules.
    <br/>
    Right now, it has exactly 0 players. Expect it to be a while before I actually play D&D again.
    <br/>
    The campaign is set in a sci-fi world, with aspects of fantasy and magic intertwined along the way. The world has its own rich history, which players will get to explore firsthand.
    If you join, expect swords, combat, and fighting, but also a rich set of NPCs to interact with and learn from. Expect unique cultures, religions, and enemies. Expect vast kingdoms to explore, massive metropolises, and wastelands where you will barely survive.
    You can see the world's history play out before your very eyes. You might save the world, or through your actions, doom it instead. Its fate is in your hands.

    Oh, if you want an optimized character build, let me know.

    The Rule of Cools in effect. If you want to join with the most overpowered character you can think of using homebrew exclusively from dandwiki, I'm fine with it.
    Howeder, do keep in mind that for each and every bit of cheese there is an equal and opposite reaction.
    <br/>
    I typically run a more open world than a traditional linear plot. Unlike normal, this campaign does have a somewhat fixed plot. While there are sidequests and plenty of room for you to change the big picture, there is an intended course of events.
    This is still mostly open-world, though. If you want to blow up the moon and use dark magic to enslave the world, you can. If you derail the entire campaign, the world will react.
    <br/>
    NPCs are people, too. The boss will not sit still while you take your time killing their minions. If you stand outside the boss room for an hour planning, expect the boss to be listening through the door. If you kill someone, there will be people who miss them, and people who will want revenge for their death.
    Your character's actions can have consequences.

    You're all still welcome to join, even if you might know some of my secrets. In fact, it'd be great if you did join - there may or may not be vague references to previous campaigns subtly hidden in the world for you to find.
    However, unlike my past campaigns where it's been nearly completely open-world, there is a semblence of a plot I'd like to maintain.
