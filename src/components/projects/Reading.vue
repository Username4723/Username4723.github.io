    <b-card-title>My Favourites (In Order)</b-card-title>

    <p>Throne of Glass</p>
    <p>Ender's Game - I've only read book 1, but it was amazing</p>
    <p>Ready Player One - Amazing. Can't wait for book 2</p>
    <p>Scythe - though book 3 took a turn for the worse</p>
    <p>To Kill a Mockingbird</p>
    <p>The Kane Chronicles - but not all the extra crossover books</p>
    <p>Percy Jackson - only the first series. The rest, though I read them, were dragged on too long</p>

    <br/>
